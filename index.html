/*

Some extra things to be aware of:

- Try to fully quit out of every chart on the page (go back to the main menu or settings menu) before playing a new chart to avoid weird behavior. (working on something to detect an active window)
- The .sm conversion is not yet bug-free. Try to avoid unnecessary blank lines and comments. (will align the conversion with technical specs later)
- Any kind of seek (clicking the timeline bar or using the key configs) will automatically play/resume the song.
